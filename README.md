## About this Project
This app follows the basic framework of a social network's API. Although this project does not have a frontend component, the backend contains the routes that would allow a user to create a profile, update it, or delete it. The routes also map out how a user would share or delete their thoughts, and add or delete friendships with other users.

## Technologies

This app uses MongoDB and Mongoose as the database to store the user's info, Express for the node framework, and JavaScript to code out the functionality. It was tested in Postman (but could also be tested through Insomnia).
