# Social-Network-API

**Note** This ReadMe does not currently contain a video walkthrough. Although I had it working last night, after coming back today I am only getting a 404 error message when trying to use it in Postman and can not figure out what could have changed in the meantime. Since I have several assignments to catch up on along with the final project, for now I need to upload this as is so that I can focus on getting them completed by the end of the course, in the hopes that this will at least get a passing grade as it currently stands so that I can concentrate on the group project. I will return to this at the end of the course to figure out more, when doing so won't jeopardize my ability to meet the requirements for graduation.

## About this Project
This app follows the basic framework of a social network's API. Although this project does not have a frontend component, the backend contains the routes that would allow a user to create a profile, update it, or delete it. The routes also map out how a user would share or delete their thoughts, and add or delete friendships with other users.

## Technologies

This app uses MongoDB and Mongoose as the database to store the user's info, Express for the node framework, and JavaScript to code out the functionality. It was tested in Postman (but could also be tested through Insomnia).
